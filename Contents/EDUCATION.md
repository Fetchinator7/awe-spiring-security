        >**WARNING 1:** *While running this program your machine will be extremely
        vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
        this program.*  WebGoat's default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
        the exposure.

        these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
        you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
        Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
        first thing that all hackers claim.*
